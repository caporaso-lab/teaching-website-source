Course materials
================

Syllabus
--------

The course syllabus is available `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_glGXLayhG7NXJUMmNCQlVwOTA/view?usp=sharing>`_.

Lecture notes
-------------

All of my lecture notes are publicly accessible, either through `SpeakerDeck <https://speakerdeck.com/gregcaporaso>`_ (for slides), `Gist <https://gist.github.com/gregcaporaso>`_ (for IPython Notebooks, python scripts, data sets, etc), or `An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics <http://readIAB.org>`_. See the ``Lecture slides`` and ``Primary reading`` columns in the course schedule (linked above) to find links to the materials for a lecture.

Text book
---------

The text book for this class is `An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics <http://readIAB.org>`_. This is a free, online book. Currently there is no paper copy available.

IPython Notebook
----------------

The IPython Notebook server used in class is accessible `here <https://dana.ucc.nau.edu:8887/>`_. You'll get the password in class. Note that you can only access this system from NAU IP addresses, included ethernet connections on campus, via the NAU wireless network, or via VPN when off-campus. Thanks to ITS Academic Computing for supporting this server for our class.

**IMPORTANT: you cannot leave any data in the class IPython Notebook server. You should always download your saved notebooks when you're done working on them for the day, and then re-upload them when you're ready to continue working.** Notebooks left on the server can be deleted at any time. The notebook server is restarted nightly at 4:30am, so any commands that are running at that time will be interrupted, and working at that time will make you especially prone to losing some data.

Office Hours
============

`Office hours for Dr. Caporaso and the TA for this class are listed on Dr. Caporaso's main teaching website <http://caporasolab.us/teaching/#office-hours>`_.

Turning in your homework by email
=================================

Your homework must always be turned in with a standardized name. That name should be ``<nau_id>_<homework_id>.<extension>``, where ``<nau_id>`` is your NAU identifier (for example, mine is ``jgc53``), and ``<homework_id>`` and ``<extension>`` are provided on a per-assignment basis.

Unless otherwise noted, homework must be turned in by email to Arron (ams379@nau.edu) before class on the day it is due.

Other information
=================

CS 499 counts as a Technical Elective for Computer Science and Applied Computer Science degree programs. BIO 499 counts as a major elective for the Biology degree programs.
