Course schedule
=========================

The course schedule is available online as a google document `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvglGXLayhG7dERwWWVmZERBeGQtRjRZLVZ3RmJTTlE&hl=en_US#gid=0>`_.

It is very likely that this schedule will change over the course of the semester as we identify certain areas that we’ll need to spend additional time on – for that reason the outline is provided in a dynamic format. The spreadsheet at the above link will always be the definitive source for the outline, reading assignments, and homework assignments.

Dates listed as ``Catch-up lecture`` will have the topic determined as the date approaches. I'll update those in the spreadsheet when the time comes. These are to allow time for us to spend on additional material of interest, or to focus on topics that need some extra lecture time.

Homework assignments listed as ``LPTHW exercises ...`` refer to exercises in `Learning Python the Hard Way`. You can find these `here <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_. Readings listed as ``Hunter...`` refer to sections in `The Processes of Life`. All other assignments will be updated as the time approaches.
