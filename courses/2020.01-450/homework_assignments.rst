.. important:: I encourage you to discuss homework assignments with each other, but you may not view other student's assignments or share your assignment with others.

Homework assignments will be listed here as they are assigned.

Turning in your homework by email
---------------------------------

Your homework must always be turned in with a standardized name. That name should be ``<nau_id>-<homework_id>.<extension>``, where ``<nau_id>`` is your NAU identifier (for example, mine is ``jgc53``), and ``<homework_id>`` and ``<extension>`` are provided on a per-assignment basis. **Assignments that are not turned in according to these specifications will lose 10%.**

Unless otherwise noted, homework must be turned in by email to Greg (greg.caporaso@nau.edu) before class on the day it is due.

Assignment 1: GC content (see schedule for due date, 20 points)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Download a genome and compute its GC content. Copy or download `the assignment template <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iY1sfH9uKulmO0CLugtQOzBoAIGqh0oIwzZfa1ARay0/edit?usp=sharing>`_, fill in your answers, and turn the assignment in by email as a PDF. **While you will get started on this assignment in class (optionally in small groups), you will complete the questions in assignment yourself.**

Note that there are various ways that you can just look up the GC content, including via the IMG website. I'm asking you to compute it, and you're being graded on your descriptions. Getting the right answer is a bonus (i.e., if you spend a couple of hours trying, and get it wrong, you'll be graded on your well-documented effort, not your final answer).

Hints: Start with the `NCBI Genome Browser <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome>`_, and work with a bacterial, archaeal or viral genome. You can also work with a eukaryote genome, but it may be quite a bit more challenging.

Be creative - there are many ways to achieve this.

.. important::
	Homework id: ``gc-content``; Extension: ``pdf``; For this first assignment, the file I turn in would be named ``jgc53-gc-content.pdf``.
