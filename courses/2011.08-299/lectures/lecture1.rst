Lecture 1: Course Overview
==========================

**Goals for today**
 * Introduce course goals, grading policy, and materials.
 * The programming notebook: what is expected?
 * Introduce Bioinformatics as a field of study, and types of biological data.

**What is bioinformatics?** It's a good question: the field is very new and it's hard to find a consistent definition. One definition is *the application of algorithms, databases, and statistical methods to address biological questions*.

**What roles must bioinformatics fill? Where can we go?**
 * algorithm development and optimization
 * interface development
 * visualization
 * development of statistical methods (non-parametric statistics, machine learning, ...)

**Biology is swamped in data.**
 * genome sequences
 * novel organisms (mostly microorganisms)
 * new gene sequences: what do they do?
 * gene expression data
 * molecular structure data
 * microbial community profile data and metagenomes
 * *-ome* data: genomes, proteomes, transcriptomes, microbiomes, metagenomes, the list goes on and on and on...

**What are we going to cover this semester?**
 * Very focused introduction to molecular biology (a molecular biology class will be extremely valuable if you want to pursue bioinformatics as a career)
 * Python programming
 * How to find, understand, and evaluate Bioinformatics software to address specific problems (don't reinvent the wheel!). 
 * How to use, integrate, or extend software developed by others.

**Where should you be able to go next?**
 * Consider the new Bioinformatics track at NAU (currently in development; contact `Greg Caporaso <mailto:gregcaporaso+bioi@gmail.com>`_ for details).
 * Join a research lab: independent study, senior thesis, volunteer for the summer in a lab at NAU, internships.
