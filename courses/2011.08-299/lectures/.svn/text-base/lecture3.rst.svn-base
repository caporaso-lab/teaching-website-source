Lecture 3: From DNA to protein (part 1): DNA to mRNA
====================================================

.. warning:: We're going to start hitting the biology pretty hard, and you're responsible for understanding the concepts in my lectures and in the text. If you don't understand a concept, look it up! A good place to start is `Molecular Biology of the Cell <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/>`_ or `Stryer Biochemistry <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21154/>`_  on the NIH Bookshelf.

**Transcription in the bacteria and the eukaryotes** Final levels of proteins are affected by the efficiency of each step in the process from DNA to protein, as well as rates of degradation of mRNA and protein.

**One gene to one protein is NOT accurate**: it's a many-to-many relationship
* Overlapping genes
* Introns and alternative (cis-)splicing
* Alternative genetic codes
* Trans-splicing

**Gene expression: different levels of expression governed by many factors**

You can find discussion of these points, as well as many of the figures I used, in Molecular Biology of the Cell on the NIH Bookshelf `here <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21050/>`_ and `here <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26887/>`_.
