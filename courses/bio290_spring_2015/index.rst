The IPython Notebook server used in class is accessible `here <https://dana.ucc.nau.edu:8887/>`_. You'll get the password in class. Note that you can only access this system from NAU IP addresses, included ethernet connections on campus, via the NAU wireless network, or via VPN when off-campus. Thanks to ITS Academic Computing for supporting this server for our class. **IMPORTANT: you cannot leave any data in the class IPython Notebook server.

Office Hours

`Office hours for Dr. Caporaso and the TAs for this class are listed on Dr. Caporaso's main teaching website <http://caporasolab.us/teaching/#office-hours>`_.

Turning in your homework by email
=================================

Your homework must always be turned in with a standardized name. That name should be ``<nau_id>_<homework_id>.<extension>``, where ``<nau_id>`` is your NAU identifier (for example, mine is ``jgc53``), and ``<homework_id>`` and ``<extension>`` are provided on a per-assignment basis.

Unless otherwise noted, homework must be turned in by email to chase.johnh@gmail.com before class on the day it is due.
