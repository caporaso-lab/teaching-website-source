Turning in your homework
------------------------
Your homework must always be turned in with a standardized name. That name should be ``<nau_id>_<homework_id>.<extension>``, where ``<nau_id>`` is your NAU identifier (for example, mine is ``jgc53``), and ``<homework_id>`` and ``<extension>`` are provided on a per-assignment basis. 

Unless otherwise noted, homework must be turned in by email to alk224@nau.edu before class on the day it is due. 

GC content (due 4 Sept 2012) 
----------------------------
Download a genome and compute its GC content (i.e., the percent of the genome that is composed of G or C). Turn in a max of one page describing the steps that you took to achieve this, including failed attempts, and the genome you selected (include a link to the download page) and the GC content that you computed.

Note that there are various ways that you can just look up the GC content, including via the IMG website. I'm asking you to compute it, and you're being graded on your description of the process. Getting the right answer is a bonus (i.e., if you spend a couple of hours trying, and get it wrong, you'll be graded on your well-documented effort, not your final answer).

Hints: Start with the IMG Genome Browser, and work with a bacterial, archaeal or viral genome.

Be creative - there are many ways to achieve this.

.. important::
	Homework id: ``gc_content``; Extension: ``pdf``; For this first assignment, the file I turn in would be named ``jgc53_gc_content.pdf``. 

Text editor (due 30 Aug 2012)
-----------------------------
Download and install a text editor. Use one of the ones recommended in PCFB. There is nothing to turn in for this assignment.
