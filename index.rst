Bioinformatics @ Northern Arizona University
====================================================

I am currently developing an undergraduate bioinformatics training program at Northern Arizona University spanning the Computer Science and Biology departments. We hope to have this made official beginning in the Fall of 2013, but in the meantime you should contact `Greg Caporaso <http://www.caporaso.us>`_ if you're interested in studying Bioinformatics at NAU. The initial courses are currently being developed and taught, so it's not too early to get started.

Getting started
---------------
*Undergraduate students*: If you're interested in getting started in Bioinformatics at NAU, you should plan to take CS/Bio 299 in the Spring of 2013. **The pre-requistes are CS 126 and Bio 181, so be sure to take these by Fall of 2012!**

*Graduate students*: In the Fall of 2012 I'll offer CS499/Bio599. This will be a great opportunity to get started in Bioinformatics and will provide the background you'll need to integrate bioinformatics into your masters or doctoral research projects.

Keeping up to date on Bioinformatics at NAU
-------------------------------------------
I maintain an email list that anyone at NAU can join to stay up-to-date on Bioinformatics-related activities at NAU. You can request to join the list `here <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/nau-bioi>`_. Topics on this list will include announcement of seminars related to Bioinformatics, announcements of class offerings, updates on the Bioinformatics training program, Bioinformatics job announcements, and other related topics. When you request to join, please fill in a sentence or two describing who you are (undergraduate student, graduate student, your department, etc). 

Current Bioinformatics Courses at NAU
======================================

Fall 2012, BIO599 / CS499 Computational Biology: Addressing Biological Questions with Computing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will be a projects-oriented course where students work in interdisciplinary teams to answer biological questions based on large genome, metagenome, or marker gene data sets. Biology students are encouraged to bring their own questions and data (e.g., related to their dissertation project), in which case projects can be designed around those data sets. Alternatively we will work with existing biological data sets. This course has not previously been taught at NAU.

For Biology students who are looking to get a head-start on the material, I highly recommend `this book <http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Computing-Biologists-Steven-Haddock/dp/0878933913>`_.

Upcoming Bioinformatics Courses at NAU
======================================

Spring 2013, BIO299 / CS299 Bioinformatics I
--------------------------------------------

This course covers introductory topics in bioinformatics, method and tool benchmarking, intermediate topics in python programming, and in depth coverage of several specific high-interest topics. This course was previous taught in Fall, 2011. The previous course website is listed above.

Fall 2013, BIO399 / CS399 Bioinformatics II
--------------------------------------------

This course is topics-oriented (ideally expanding on the special topics introduced in Bioinformatics I) using real world bioinformatics data sets and problems to explore a few techniques in much greater coverage than was achieved in Bioinformatics I. Students will learn about high-performance computing (including relevant topics in python programming), the design and implementation and presentation of bioinformatics experiments, and working in cross-disciplinary collaborative environments.  This course was previous taught in Spring, 2012. The previous course website is listed above.

Some resources for getting started with bioinformatics and python
==========================================================================================

For biologists who want to pick up computational skills
-------------------------------------------------------
| `Practical Computing for Biologists <http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Computing-Biologists-Steven-Haddock/dp/0878933913>`_ by Steven Haddock and Casey Dunn
| A great introduction to many computational skills that are required of modern biologists. I *highly* recommend this book to all Biology undergraduate and graduate students.
|
| `Practical Programming: A Introduction to Computer Science Using Python <http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Introduction-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356271>`_ by Jennifer Campbell, Paul Gries, Jason Montojo, Greg Wilson
| An introduction to the python programming language and basic computer science. This is a great first programming book for people interested in bioinformatics or scientific computing in general.
|
| `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_ by Zed Shaw
| Another good python introduction. This one is very focused on exercises and is great for practicing python. My students have complained that it doesn't provide enough background information (i.e., `what` you're doing and `why` it works) and for that reason I recommend using this in conjunction with `Practical Programming`. Beware that the two don't follow each other exactly. One strategy that some students use is to work through these exercises in order and use `Practical Programming` as a reference.

For computer scientists who want to learn some biology
------------------------------------------------------
| `The Processes of Life <http://www.amazon.com/Processes-Life-Introduction-Molecular-Biology/dp/0262013053>`_ by Lawrence Hunter
| An introduction to biology for computer scientists. (Chapter 1 is available for free `here <http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262013053chap1.pdf>`_.)
| 
| `Molecular Biology of the Cell <http://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Biology-Cell-Bruce-Alberts/dp/0815341059/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1314225305&sr=1-1>`_ by Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter
| One of the best texts on molecular biology. This is fairly advanced (it's generally used in upper division molecular biology courses) so it may not be the best place to start. You'll find it invaluable though if you plan to go on in Bioinformatics. This book is available via the NIH Bookshelf (for example, from Chapter 1: `The Universal Features of Cells on Earth <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26864/>`_ and `The Diversity of Genomes and the Tree of Life <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26866/>`_).
|
| `Brock Biology of Microorganisms <http://www.amazon.com/Brock-Biology-Microorganisms-Michael-Madigan/dp/032164963X/ref=dp_ob_title_bk>`_ by Michael T. Madigan, John M. Martinko, David Stahl, David P. Clark
| One of the best textbooks on microbiology. This is also fairly advanced, but if you're interested in microbial ecology or other aspects of microbiology it will likely be extremely useful.

For students in either discipline who want to learn some fundamental concepts in bioinformatics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `Inferring Phylogenies <http://www.amazon.com/Inferring-Phylogenies-Joseph-Felsenstein/dp/0878931775/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1326253914&sr=1-1>`_ by Joseph Felsenstein
| One of the definitive texts on algorithms used in bioinformatics: particularly focused on building phylogenetic trees.
|
| `Biological Sequence Analysis <http://www.amazon.com/Biological-Sequence-Analysis-Probabilistic-Proteins/dp/0521629713/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1326253983&sr=1-1>`_ by Richard Durbin, Sean R. Eddy, Anders Krogh, Graeme Mitchison
| Another of the definitive texts on algorithms used in bioinformatics.
|
| `Biometry <http://www.amazon.com/Biometry-Robert-R-Sokal/dp/0716786044>`_ by Robert Sokal and James Rohlf
| An excellent (and highly referenced) basic statistics book for biology.
